# Real-world project speed comparison

Compiler: `c++ (Debian 14.2.0-19) 14.2.0`. Each project is built 5 time(s) per side (system libstdc++, psychicstd); `system (s)`/`psychicstd (s)` are the *median* build time of those repetitions, in seconds -- the median is used instead of the mean so one repetition disturbed by another process on the machine doesn't skew the result. `speedup` = system median / psychicstd median (>1x means psychicstd is faster); its bracketed range is a 95% confidence interval on that *same ratio* (obtained by resampling the raw per-repetition timings, not just the two medians, 2000 times) -- so it reflects how much the repetitions varied, not a different unit. 🟢 the whole CI is above 1x (reliably faster) · 🔴 the whole CI is below 1x (reliably slower) · 🟡 the CI straddles 1x (not distinguishable from run-to-run noise).

Parallelism: **20 jobs** (20 logical CPUs available; the memory estimate permits 21 jobs at 1.5 GiB/job). ccache was disabled.

## cppcheck (2.21.0)

the complete native Makefile build is compiled and linked; Cppcheck's own test runner is run with one libstdc++ diagnostic wording test excluded.
